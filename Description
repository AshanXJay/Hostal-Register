Scenario


Problem
The main problem in our scenario is the unnecessary inconvenience and time wastage imposed on students due to the requirement of physically returning to the hostel to sign the book every time they leave the university hostel, regardless of the distance or purpose of their outing. This process disrupts their activities and requires them to go back to their hostel to update their records, causing unnecessary inconvenience and wasting their time. Additionally, relying on a physical book can lead to errors, loss of records, and difficulty in accessing and analyzing the data.
