Scenario
target audience-students who residing in university  inside hostels

purpose-to becoming easy day to day to life for university students 

context-the scenario is based on university students residing in  inside hostels withing the university.

problem-If someone need to go out from university premises..they should physically record on a book about their leavings.such as they should note about their name,room number,enrollement number and have to put sign on it. But the case is when if some student need to go outside from the university premises,when if one  student need to go outside from the university premises,when after they come to lectures in a university as usual,they have to go hostels again and update the that book.even if they are already within the campus but at a significant distance from their current location gjklki



Problem
The main problem in our scenario is the unnecessary inconvenience and time wastage students face by having to physically return to the hostel to sign the book every time they go outside, regardless of the distance from their current location.

Solution
We will create a software and give access to the security officer on duty at the main gate, the security office near the library, and all 4 hostels inside the university premises. When someone wants to go outside, like in the scenario, he or she can inform them with their enrollment number and where they want to go. Then it will be entered into the system by the officer on duty at the main gate or the security office, and the officer on duty at the relevant hostel will get notified with details about the student who leaves the university premises. Then he can update the register.
