Scenario
If someone needs to go out of the university premises, they are required to physically record their leaving in a book at the entrance of the hostel and sign on it. But if some student needs to go outside the university premises after attending a lecture in a lecture hall located far away from the hostel, they have to go back to the hostel again and sign the book, regardless of the significant distance from their current location to the hostel. As a result, a considerable number of students go out without signing the book. As an example, one student is already in a lecture at G block and needs to go to town. But before she goes out, she has to go back to the hostel to sign the book, and because of the distance she chooses to go out without signing the book, this poses a significant safety risk because if she encounters an accident or emergency, there would be no official record of her presence, and the lack of record can hinder the investigation or the necessary support that should be provided to the affected students.

Problem
The main problem in our scenario is the unnecessary inconvenience and time wastage students face by having to physically return to the hostel to sign the book every time they go outside, regardless of the distance from their current location.

Solution
Create a software and give access to the security officer on duty at the main gate, the security office near the library, and all 4 hostels inside the university premises. When someone wants to go outside, like in the scenario, he or she can inform them with their enrollment number and where they want to go. Then it will be entered into the system by the officer on duty at the main gate or the security office, and the officer on duty at the relevant hostel will get notified with details about the student who leaves the university premises. Then he can update the register.
