Scenario


Problem
The main problem in our scenario is the inconvenience and inefficiency of the manual record keeping process. Students are required to physically record their movements in a book every time they leave the university hostel, regardless of the distance or purpose of their outing. This process disrupts their activities and requires them to go back to their hostel to update their records, causing unnecessary inconvenience and wasting their time. Additionally, relying on a physical book can lead to errors, loss of records, and difficulty in accessing and analyzing the data.
