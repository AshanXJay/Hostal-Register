Scenario


Problem
The main problem in our scenario is the unnecessary inconvenience and time wastage students face by having to physically return to the hostel to sign the book every time they go outside, regardless of the distance from their current location.

Solution
We will create a software and give access to the security officer in duty on main gate, security office near the library and all 4 hostels inside the university premises. When someone want to go outside like in the scenario, He/She can inform it with their enrollment number and where they want to go. Then it will enter the system by the officer in duty at main gate or the security office and the officer in duty at relevant hostal will get notifed with details about the student who leaves the university premises. Then he can update the register book.
