Scenario
target audience-students who residing in university  inside hostels

purpose-to becoming easy day to day to life for university students 

context-the scenario is based on university students residing in  inside hostels withing the university.

problem-If someone need to go out from university premises..they should physically record on a book about their leavings.such as they should note about their name,room number,enrollement number and have to put sign on it. But the case is when if some student need to go outside from the university premises,when if one  student need to go outside from the university premises,when after they come to lectures in a university as usual,they have to go hostels again and update the that book.even if they are already within the campus but at a significant distance from their current location .Imagine one student already in g6 hall and she  need to go town ,but before go out have to go hostel called cattleya to update that book.

solution-the deveplopment of a software solution that would eliminate the needing physically sighn the book.

efficiency-it can reduce time wasting and haave a posibility to prohobit the unnesssesary incudents that students face if someone go out from university premises without updating the book.suc as if someone face vehicle acccident or harrasment by someone in outside ,even though they don't update that book about teir leaves,it will be a enormouse problem.students don't need getting physically lived.

process-students can easily approch the university security room and able show their university identity card and able to update that book systamatically.when someone update that book like this ,the security guide in hostels can see it through their computer screen.aafter that he or she can update that book in physically about student's leavings.after come to hostel students can update that book physically conveying about coming back to hostel.


Problem
The main problem in our scenario is the unnecessary inconvenience and time wastage students face by having to physically return to the hostel to sign the book every time they go outside, regardless of the distance from their current location.

Solution
We will create a software and give access to the security officer on duty at the main gate, the security office near the library, and all 4 hostels inside the university premises. When someone wants to go outside, like in the scenario, he or she can inform them with their enrollment number and where they want to go. Then it will be entered into the system by the officer on duty at the main gate or the security office, and the officer on duty at the relevant hostel will get notified with details about the student who leaves the university premises. Then he can update the register.
