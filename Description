Scenario


Problem
The main problem in our scenario is the unnecessary inconvenience and time wastage students face by having to physically return to the hostel to sign the book every time they go outside, regardless of the distance from their current location.

Solution
We will create a software and give access to the security officer on duty at the main gate, the security office near the library, and all 4 hostels inside the university premises. When someone wants to go outside, like in the scenario, he or she can inform them with their enrollment number and where they want to go. Then it will be entered into the system by the officer on duty at the main gate or the security office, and the officer on duty at the relevant hostel will get notified with details about the student who leaves the university premises. Then he can update the register.
