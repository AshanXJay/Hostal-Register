Scenario
If someone needs to go out from the university premises. They are required to physically record on a book about their leaving. Such as they should note their name, room number, enrollment number and sign on it. But the case if some student needs to go outside the university premises after they attended to a lecture in a lecture hall located on the opposite side of the campus from the hostel, they have to go back to the hostel again and update the book regardless of the significant distance from their current location to the hostel. Imagine one student already in g6 hall and she needs to go to the town but before she goes out, she has to go back to the hostel called Cattleya to update the book despite the distance. As a result, if she chooses to go out without signing the book, this poses a significant safety risk because if she encounters an accident or emergency, there would be no official record of her presence and the lack of record can hinder the investigation or necessary support that should be provided to the affected students.

Problem
The main problem in our scenario is the unnecessary inconvenience and time wastage students face by having to physically return to the hostel to sign the book every time they go outside, regardless of the distance from their current location.

Solution
We will create a software and give access to the security officer on duty at the main gate, the security office near the library, and all 4 hostels inside the university premises. When someone wants to go outside, like in the scenario, he or she can inform them with their enrollment number and where they want to go. Then it will be entered into the system by the officer on duty at the main gate or the security office, and the officer on duty at the relevant hostel will get notified with details about the student who leaves the university premises. Then he can update the register.
