Function login takes entered_username and entered_password as parameters and returns a pointer to character:

    If file is NULL (meaning the file could not be opened):

        Return NULL

    Call the encrypt_password function with entered_password to encrypt the entered password
    Call the encrypt_username function with entered_username to encrypt the entered username

    Define a character array line of size MAX_SIZE

    While there are lines to read from the file:
        Read a line from the file into line
        Split the line at "`" and assign the first token to username
        Split the remaining string at "`" and assign the next token to password
        Split the remaining string at "\n" and assign the next token to role

        If username, password, and role are not NULL and username matches entered_username and password matches entered_password:
            Close the file
            Return a copy of role
